<h1>Welcome, I'm Lawrence</h1>

<h2>So...what is this??</h2>

<p>
This here is *currently* a placeholder site that will eventually serve as my PhD work repo.
I'm undecided on whether to share my workflow as a jupyter notebook, or a full on site 
(whichever has less time pressure). But either here or buried in the filesystem,
you will find 'most' of the files and code/scripts for all the simulations and analysis I've run.
This will NOT include full trajectories for all simulations because *oh boy* they are hefty.
If you would like access to these, I am willing to share with the wider community...
*after* thesis submission, corrections, and (hopefully) acceptance. I think that's fair.

<p>
If it's 2025 and this still hasn't changed, I have probably been eaten by rabid 
llamas and have larger concerns than updating this; my apologies.
